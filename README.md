# Portfolio Website

This is a simple and responsive portfolio website created to showcase my projects, skills, and a short video introduction. It is built using basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Live Site

## About This Project

The purpose of this project was to develop a personal portfolio website as a part of my academic learning. It includes the following sections:

- Introduction video
- Navigation bar
- About me
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact information

This project helped me better understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build a complete static web page.

## Technologies Used

- **Git-copilot** – for code generation
- **D-ID** – for ai generated video
- **Netlify** – For hosting and deploying the live site
